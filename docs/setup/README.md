# Setup Documentation

This directory holds all information on how the device was setup given certain conditions. Those conditions include:

- Arizona State University Security
- Ubuntu 18.04.\*


## Ubuntu Setup

The ubuntu setup documentation will provide the user with information on how to set up their computer to run these notebooks. Certain versions of Docker, Ubuntu, Anaconda and Python are all required to have everything running smoothly. 

The main installation consists of FINN and Docker. Setting up docker contains more information as it requires being set up as non-root. (Which I assume is for security reasons). Not having all of these dependencies installed may result in un-resolveable errors.

Licenses will be required for some software like Vitis and Vivado from Xilinx. This software has been provided by Arizona State University for purposes of this project.

_Conditions will be updated as time progresses_
