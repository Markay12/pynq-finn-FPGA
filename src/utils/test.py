The function sets the model to evaluation mode, disables gradient computation, 
and iterates through the test data loader, passing each batch of images through the 
model to get predicted labels. It then compares the predicted labels to the true labels 
and calculates the percentage of correct predictions (accuracy) over the entire test 
dataset. Finally, the function returns the accuracy value as a float.
